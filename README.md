Dynamic mode decomposition with Control for Data-driven Modeling of Anaerobic Digestion Process.

This repository contains the matlab code related to the  CARI2022 conference paper (Dynamic mode decomposition with Control for Data-driven Modeling of Anaerobic Digestion Process.) that you can find here: https://www.cari-info.org/cari2022-prog/ or in the HAL archive in this link : https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03696038v1.

# Abstract 

This paper proposes a data-driven modeling approach for complex anaerobic digestion systems.
This method is called Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc), which is an emerging
equation-free technique for deducing global linear state-space input-output models with actuation
for complex systems. DMDc was applied to a set of data generated from simulating the ordinary
differential equations of the Anaerobic Model 2 (AM2) using MATLAB. The simulation results
demonstrate the accuracy of the linear state-space model generated from the DMDc algorithm.

# Code

The matlab code is organized as follows:
By executing the file named "AM2DMDc.m " the result will show up right the way. The file "AM2Model.m" contains the diffentrial equations of the AM2 model and "DMDc.m" is the code for the DMDc method.
